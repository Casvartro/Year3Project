# Year3Project
Unity 3D Game Development Project

This is my third year project I created for my dissertation.
It is a FPS action game where the player faces waves of enemies.
The enemy AI is programmed with a behaviour tree system based on the framework of github.com/GrymmyD/UnityBehaviourTree.
The player has items available to access that will restore health and ammo values. The player also has access to powerups that can modify their
abilities.

Once the project is downloaded, unzip and open the path in the Unity client.
